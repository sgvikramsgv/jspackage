#Enable Co-Browsing on the Customer Website

This article describes ways to enable Co-Browsing solution on Customer Website.

## Planning 

Before you begin implementing Co-Browsing for your application, think of an approach that would be most beneficial for your customers.
Enabling a blind Co-Browsing on the entire domain might become troublesome. 

Ensure you:

* Enable Co-Browsing on the Customer website page only if it has data where customers might need help.
* Plan the navigation of the users on the Co-Browsing and off the Co-Browsing page
* Review the contents on the Co-Browsing page
* Plan a strategy on the elements that are present on the Co-Browsing page
* Put the ads and or third party contents/videos/external links if any, under no show elements.
* Review any sensitive fields where Customer might type some information that should not be shared with the Agent e.g. password fields, credit card number fields etc.
* Get the UI reviewed for a UX (User Experience Designer) stand point, so that optimization and user experience do not run into each other.
* Analysis of website to be cobrowsed with against JS libraries used in Co-Browsing solution against any potential conflict.
* NAMESPACE analysis of the website against Co-Browsing solution's NAMESPACE for any potential conflict

## Dealing with DOM objects

Co-Browsing supports the default DOM objects which are supported as per HTML 5 standards except for canvas, video/audio controls, input type date.
We have done extensive testing on most commonly used UI <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en/docs/Web/HTML/Element" target="_blank">Elements</a>
from Twitter bootstrap and JQuery UI stack.

It can be used to group elements for styling purposes (using the˙class˙or˙id˙attributes), or because they share attribute values, such as˙lang. It should be used only when no other semantic element (such as˙&lt;article&gt;˙or˙&lt;nav&gt;) is appropriate.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             | Yes                                                                                            |

| &lt;dt&gt;                           | The˙HTML˙&lt;dt&gt;˙element˙(or HTML Definition Term Element) identifies a term in a definition list. This element can occur only as a child element of a˙&lt;dl&gt;. It is usually followed by a˙&lt;dd&gt;˙element; however, multiple˙&lt;dt&gt;˙elements in a row indicate several terms that are all defined by the immediate next˙&lt;dd&gt;˙element.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Yes                                                                                            |

| &lt;figure&gt;                       | The˙HTML˙&lt;figure&gt;˙Element˙represents self-contained content, frequently with a caption˙(&lt;figcaption&gt;),˙and is˙typically referenced as a single unit. While it is related to the main flow, its position is independent of the main flow. Usually this is an image, an illustration, a diagram, a code snippet, or a schema that is referenced in the main text, but that can be moved to another page or to an appendix without affecting the main flow.                                                                                                                                                                                           | No                                                                                             |
| &lt;hr&gt;                           | The˙HTML˙&lt;hr&gt;˙element˙represents a thematic break between paragraph-level elements (for example, a change of scene in a story, or a shift of topic with a section). In previous versions of HTML, it represented a horizontal rule. It may still be displayed as a horizontal rule in visual browsers, but is now defined in semantic terms, rather than presentational terms.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     | Yes                                                                                            |

It must be contained in a parent element: an ordered list (&lt;ol&gt;), an unordered list (&lt;ul&gt;), or a menu (&lt;menu&gt;). In menus and unordered lists, list items are usually displayed using bullet points. In ordered lists, they are usually displayed with an ascending counter on the left, such as a number or letter.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | Yes                                                                                            |
| &lt;main&gt;                         | The˙HTML Main Element˙(&lt;main&gt;) can be used as a container for the dominant contents of the document. The main content area consists of content that is directly related to, or expands upon the central topic of a section or the central functionality of an application. This content should be unique to the document, excluding any content that is repeated across a set of documents such as sidebars, navigation links, copyright information, site logos, and search forms (unless, of course, the document's main function is as a search form). Unlike˙&lt;article&gt;and˙&lt;section&gt;, this element does not contribute to the document outline. | Yes                                                                                            |
| &lt;ol&gt;                           | The˙HTML˙&lt;ol&gt;˙Element˙(or˙HTML Ordered List Element) represents an ordered list of items.

| background-origin                           | This property determines whether the background should be places in the padding box, the border box, or the content box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          | Yes                                                                                            |
| background-size                           | This property allows you to indicate the size of the background image. It allows you to stretch smaller images to fit the page.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       | Yes                                                                                            |
| background-repeat                   | There are two new values for this property: space and round. Space spaces the tiled image evenly within the box without being clipped. Round rescales the background image so that it will tile a whole number of times in the box.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        | Yes

| background-attachment                       | A new value local is added so that the background will scroll with the element content when that element has a scroll bar.                                                                                                                                                                                           | No                                                                                             |
